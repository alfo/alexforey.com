				<h2>Outdoor Advertising Directory</h2>
				<p class="description">I was hired by Sam Stuttard to create a website for his startup, which is based in Glasgow. I designed the site using Bootstrap, SASS and Javascript, created the backend using Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL, and got it on the internet using Amazon EC2, S3 and Unicorn.</p>
				<p class="description">The site was turned around from concept to reality in less than two months, and it included integration with Stripe for payment processing as well as SVG-only graphics for sharp rendering on Retina and other HiDPI screens. I also set up the servers to communicate over HTTPS with an SSL certificate, to ensure the customers' data was secure when passing through the tubes of the internet.</p>
				<p class="description">The Outdoor Advertising Directory was recently sold on to a new owner, and as such is currently down for server maintenance.</p>

				<h4>No Context</h4><time>November 2013</time>
				<p>For some comic relief, and having just bought a Little Printer, I decided that it would be fun to make a publication that took a top post from <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nocontext">/r/nocontext</a> every day. Source on <a href="https://github.com/alfo/NoContext">GitHub</a>.</p>
