		<p>Well, what can I say? You already know I'm 16... well. I live in London. I run a blog, <a href="http://newfangled.me" target="_blank">Newfangled Me</a> in which I talk about things that matter to my and some of my projects. It was started on 7th September 2011, which happened to be my birthday. Why? It makes it easier for me to remember the birthday of my blog.</p>
	
		<p>I've been interested in Technical Theatre (lighting and sound design) since I was 8, and I've run lighting, sound and projection multiple shows. I've always been interested in photography and how stuff works, and I've been interested in making films since I was around 10. I can teach myself new skills fairly easily.</p>
	
		<p>Some of my major influences when it comes to film are JJ Abrams, Steve Lawes and Fabian Wagner (DPs on <a href="http://sherlockology.com" target="_blank">Sherlock (BBC)</a>), as well as numerous others. I taught myself to make films, with early help from the sadly terminated <a href="http://indymogul.com" target="_blank">Indy Mogul</a>, specifically their <a href="http://www.indymogul.com/tag/BFX" target="_blank">BFX Series</a>. I never have any budget, and I usually don't intend to make any profit, I just make films with friends for fun.</p>
	
		<p>I used to <a href="http://youtube.com/foreya" target="_blank">make stop motion animations</a>, and have done so ever since I was 8. I even did an <a href="http://www.esbuk.org//content/Home.aspx" target="_blank">ESB Exam</a> on the subject.<p>
	
		<p>In terms of social networks, I've had Facebook since I was 12 1/2 (I know - so badass), and Twitter for about 2 years (I had a previous account which I've now lost).</p>
	
		<p>I learnt HTML and CSS fairly early at the age of around 12, and expanded that to PHP around 13 when I learnt of <a href="https://phpacademy.org">phpAcademy</a>. Then I heard about the Little Printer and how easy it was to create content for it, so I went along to a few of their "<a href="http://bergcloud.com/2012/09/20/little-printer-after-school-club/">After School Clubs</a>" and heard from some of the other attendees about how awful PHP was in doing basically everything, and so I decided to learn Ruby - which appeared to be what all the cool kids were using. I started by watching <a href="http://www.lynda.com/Ruby-Rails-tutorials/Ruby-Rails-3-Essential-Training/55960-2.html">this Lynda series</a> and then followed that up with a lot of <a href="http://railscasts.com">Railscasts</a>. I haven't learnt the nitty-gritty of Ruby yet, I just know the parts that I need for efficient web development. From there I decided the best way to really get to know my way around Rails was to redesign Markpond in it, and so I did. Through doing so, I learnt how to properly use gems to outsource pieces of application logic and to interact with APIs. I also learnt Sinatra and SASS at around the same time, and much of the projects that resulted I've put on <a href="https://github.com/alfo?tab=repositories">GitHub</a>.</p>
		
		<p>When I was 13, I was asked to film and make DVDs of the school play, and since then I've filmed more than 15 school plays and live events, and make a total of over 300 DVDs.</p>
		
		<p>From there, I helped out with some open-source projects that I found interesting and useful. My next few Little Printer publications were written in Ruby.</p>
		
		<p>At around the same time, I got into developing with Arduino, after having graciously been given one by <a href="http://designswarm.com">Alexandra Deschamps-Sonsino</a>. I now have several Arduinos, an Ethernet shield, a DMX shield, several OLED and LCD displays, a relay system and a <a href="http://bergcloud.com/platform/">BERGCloud Devshield</a>, which is my favourite. I'm developing my first serious IoT project using the BERGCloud Devshield, which I'll finish at some point after my GCSEs. Also through Alexandra, I began filming <a href="http://thishappened.org/">This Happened</a>, a series of events focussing on interaction design. I'm still attending and taking photos for their Flickr pool today.</p>
